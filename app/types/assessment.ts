You may not feel terrible all the time â€” but at the cellular level, your terrain is likely stuck, congested, or collapsing under load.\n\nThat's not failure. It's your body safely limiting change until conditions improve.\n\nThis is the hardest phase to see clearly, but also the most essential to start. Once exits unblock and pressure softens, healing becomes possible again.",

These create functional blockages â€” not just symptoms â€” that make it hard to adapt to even helpful inputs.\n\nThat doesn't mean your body isn't trying. It means it's holding the line until conditions are safer.\n\nWe begin by clearing space â€” so your system can stop protecting and start responding.",

But you do need targeted sequencing â€” supporting what's ready, while softening what's not.\n\nThis is where momentum builds â€” if you work with your terrain, not against it.",

The work ahead is to sustain that state under stress, deepen system flexibility, and eventually support others still on their way.",
