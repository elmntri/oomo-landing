Michael Chen I just realized that I can’t do Section 3 by onboarding phase, so I have to rethink the customization a bit. But here is the rest of it so you can start with it, if desired.

Terrain Results Page (GTM)

Goal:

- Fewer Sections
- Sell (Curiosity), don’t explain (TMI)

Section 1 & 2: Customized by Terrain Score

🟥 Group A (1–20): Dysfunction

🧠 What Your Score Reveals
Your body is protecting itself.
This score reflects a system under significant internal strain. You may not feel terrible all the time — but at the cellular level, your terrain is likely stuck, congested, or collapsing under load.

That’s not failure. It’s your body safely limiting change until conditions improve.

This is the hardest phase to see clearly, but also the most essential to start. Once exits unblock and pressure softens, healing becomes possible again.

---

🟧 Group B (21–40): Low Capacity

🧠 What Your Score Reveals
Your terrain is overloaded.
This score shows your system is still working through some combination of congestion, rigidity, depletion, or timing misalignment. These create functional blockages — not just symptoms — that make it hard to adapt to even helpful inputs.

That doesn’t mean your body isn’t trying. It means it’s holding the line until conditions are safer.

We begin by clearing space — so your system can stop protecting and start responding.

---

🟨 Group C (41–60): Transitional State

🧠 What Your Score Reveals
You’re close — but still blocked.
This score reflects a system that has pieces in place, but one or more bottlenecks are still dragging down your overall readiness. That might be drainage, charge, override, or structural stuckness.

You don’t need to overhaul everything. But you do need targeted sequencing — supporting what’s ready, while softening what’s not.

This is where momentum builds — if you work with your terrain, not against it.

---

🟩 Group D (61–80): Emerging Stability

🧠 What Your Score Reveals
Your system is beginning to stabilize.
This score reflects a terrain with improving coherence, charge, and flexibility — strong enough to take on more input, but not yet fully locked in. One or two systems may still wobble under stress.

The key now is integration: making sure signal clarity and rhythm hold under real-world complexity.

This is where the work gets smarter, not harder.

---

🟦 Group E (81–100): Readiness

🧠 What Your Score Reveals
Your system is capable of receiving.
This score reflects a terrain with strong signs of coherence, open exits, buffered charge, and stable rhythms.

That doesn’t guarantee everything is optimal — but it does suggest your body is ready to amplify healing, not resist it.

This is where health becomes expansive. The work ahead is to sustain that state under stress, deepen system flexibility, and eventually support others still on their way.

Section 3: Customized by Various Scores

Section 4: Same for everyone

What You’ll Unlock When oomo Opens

You won’t get a list of things to try.
You’ll get a starting point—and a clear path forward.

oomo is built to guide you through health in the right order, based on how real systems work: feedback, timing, and readiness.

You’ll begin with a phase that fits your current state, then unlock new actions as your system stabilizes.

This isn’t textbook learning.
It’s personalized learning through experience—with the clarity to know what matters, when.

Theory chases inputs.
We care about outcomes.
Can your system oscillate? Can it adapt without collapse?
That’s what real resilience looks like.

Section 5: Same for everyone

CTA: Save your score, and we’ll let you know when oomo opens. Come back then to keep learning—with your own system as the textbook.
